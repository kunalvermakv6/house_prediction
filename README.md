#  House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the sale price of houses using supervised machine learning techniques. It leverages a rich dataset of property features to train, evaluate, and deploy regression models for accurate price estimation.

---

##  Problem Statement

House buyers, sellers, and investors often struggle to estimate property prices accurately due to multiple influencing factors. The goal of this project is to build a reliable machine learning model that can predict house prices based on historical data and property features.

##  Proposed Solution

The proposed solution involves:
- Collecting and preprocessing housing data
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Training various regression models (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Evaluating models using R², MAE, and RMSE
- Deploying the best-performing model for prediction
